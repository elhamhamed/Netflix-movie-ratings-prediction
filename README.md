# Netflix-movie-ratings-prediction

**Overview**

The Netflix Movie Ratings Prediction project is a machine learning project that aims to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, cast, and runtime. The project uses a dataset of movie ratings collected from Netflix and employs various machine learning algorithms to make predictions

Recommendation system is the most profitable solution for the organization that offers its services to a number of users who have a number of options. As the name suggests, the system uses algorithms to recommend content (videos, ads, news, etc.) to an individual based on their usage.

Content based method utilizes more information about user and items to create a model that learns how a user having certain features will prefer a particular item having a set of characteristics over other items. Content based method uses available information about user and items like features of a user or characteristic or content of an item that explain the interaction between the user and item. The method doesn’t suffer from poor recommendations due to insufficient beginner data.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is a collection of movie ratings collected from Netflix. The dataset includes various features such as genre, cast, and runtime, and is available

**Requirements**
•Data Preprocessing (Cleaning Data, Normalization)
• Split your data set into train data and test data (If the data is not split)
• You will use a suitable algorithm for your dataset. (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Association, etc...).
• The programming language you will be using is python and its libraries (Pandas, Numby, Matplot, Seaborn, Scikitlearn, etc...).
• After prediction, you will work on Evaluation metric.

Data Preprocessing**

Before you can begin training and testing your machine learning model, you will need to preprocess the dataset. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the data :

   •Data Cleaning:
        Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing inaccurate or irrelevant
        data from the dataset. This may involve handling missing orduplicated data, dealing with outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
        
   •Data Normalization:
        Data normalization is the process of scaling the values of the dataset so that they fall
        within a specific range or distribution. This is important to ensure
        that the data is comparable and that the machine learning algorithm can make accurate predictions.
        
   • Feature Selection:
        Feature selection involves identifying the most relevant features in the dataset that will be used to make predictions.
        This can be done by analyzing the correlation between features and the target variable, and removing any features that
        are redundant or irrelevant.
