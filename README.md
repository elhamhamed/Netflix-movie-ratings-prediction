# Netflix-movie-ratings-prediction
**Overview**

The Netflix Movie Ratings Prediction project is a machine learning project that aims to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, cast, and runtime. The project uses a dataset of movie ratings collected from Netflix and employs various machine learning algorithms to make predictions
Recommendation system is the most profitable solution for the organization that offers its services to a number of users who have a number of options. As the name suggests, the system uses algorithms to recommend content (videos, ads, news, etc.) to an individual based on their usage.
Content based method utilizes more information about user and items to create a model that learns how a user having certain features will prefer a particular item having a set of characteristics over other items. Content based method uses available information about user and items like features of a user or characteristic or content of an item that explain the interaction between the user and item. The method doesn’t suffer from poor recommendations due to insufficient beginner data.

**Problem Statement**

The goal of this project is to find similarity within groups of people to build a movie recommendation system for users. We are going to analyze a dataset from the Netflix database to explore the characteristics that people share in movies. We have experienced it ourselves or have been in the room, the endless scrolling of selecting what to watch. Users spend more time deciding what to watch than watching their movie.

**Data Summery**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Fixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.
•	Show_Id: Unique ID for every Movie / Tv Show

**Requirements**

•Data Preprocessing (Cleaning Data, Normalization)
• Split your data set into train data and test data (If the data is not split)
• You will use a suitable algorithm for your dataset. (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Association, etc...).
• The programming language you will be using is python and its libraries (Pandas, Numby, Matplot, Seaborn, Scikitlearn, etc...).
• After prediction, you will work on Evaluation metric.

**•Data Preprocessing**

Before you can begin training and testing your machine learning model, you will need to preprocess the dataset. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the data :

  **•Data Cleaning:**
  
   Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing inaccurate or irrelevant
   data from the dataset. This may involve handling missing orduplicated data, dealing with outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
        
  **•Data Normalization**:
  
   Data normalization is the process of scaling the values of the dataset so that they fall within a specific range or distribution. This is important to ensure
   that the data is comparable and that the machine learning algorithm can make accurate predictions.
        
**• Feature Selection:** 

   Feature selection involves identifying the most relevant features in the dataset that will be used to make predictions.
   This can be done by analyzing the correlation between features and the target variable, and removing any features that
   are redundant or irrelevant.


**Conclusion**
In conclusion, tailored recommendations can be made based on information about movies and TV shows. In addition, similar models can be developed to provide valuable recommendations to consumers in other domains. It will solve for improved movie and TV-Show selection times with a considerable growth in satisfaction of the content being consumed leading to more user engagement and greater trust in Netflix recommendations.
